# GNU C Language Manual

This is a mirror of **Ritchard Stallman's GNU C Language Intro and Reference**
converted to **Markdown**. It gets updated every two weeks or so, if there's
available changes at the
[repository](https://git.savannah.nongnu.org/cgit/c-intro-and-ref.git/). Also,
if you find any flaws, including any passage that is unclear or hard
to understand. Please consider opening an issue, so I can pass them on.
