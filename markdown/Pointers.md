## 14 Pointers 


Among high-level languages, C is rather low level, close to the machine.
This is mainly because it has explicit *pointers*. A pointer value is
the numeric address of data in memory. The type of data to be found at
that address is specified by the data type of the pointer itself. The
unary operator '`*`' gets the data that a pointer points
to---this is called *dereferencing the pointer*.

C also allows pointers to functions, but since there are some
differences in how they work, we treat them later. See [Function
Pointers](Function-Pointers.md).
