### 24.4 Operand Promotions 


The operands in arithmetic operations undergo type conversion
automatically. These *operand promotions* are the same as the argument
promotions except without converting `float` to `double`. In other
words, the operand promotions convert

-   `char` or `short` (whether signed or not) to `int`.
-   an array to a pointer to its zeroth element, and
-   a function name to a pointer to that function.
