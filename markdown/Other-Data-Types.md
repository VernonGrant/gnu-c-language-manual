### 11.5 Other Data Types 

Beyond the primitive types, C provides several ways to construct new
data types. For instance, you can define *pointers*, values that
represent the addresses of other data (see [Pointers](Pointers.md)).
You can define *structures*, as in many other languages (see
[Structures](Structures.md)), and *unions*, which specify multiple
ways to look at the same memory space (see [Unions](Unions.md)).
*Enumerations* are collections of named integer codes (see [Enumeration
Types](Enumeration-Types.md)).

*Array types* in C are used for allocating space for objects, but C does
not permit operating on an array value as a whole. See
[Arrays](Arrays.md).
