#### 26.6.1 Uses of Conditional Directives 

There are three usual reasons to use a preprocessing conditional.

-   A program may need to use different code depending on the machine or
    operating system it is to run on. In some cases the code for one
    operating system may be erroneous on another operating system; for
    example, it might refer to data types or constants that do not exist
    on the other system. When this happens, it is not enough to avoid
    executing the invalid code. Its mere presence will cause the
    compiler to reject the program. With a preprocessing conditional,
    the offending code can be effectively excised from the program when
    it is not valid.
-   You may want to be able to compile the same source file into two
    different programs. One version might make frequent time-consuming
    consistency checks on its intermediate data, or print the values of
    those data for debugging, and the other not.
-   A conditional whose condition is always false is one way to exclude
    code from the program but keep it as a sort of comment for future
    reference.

Simple programs that do not need system-specific logic or complex
debugging hooks generally will not need to use preprocessing
conditionals.
