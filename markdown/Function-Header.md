#### 1.1.1 Function Header 


In our example, the first two lines of the function definition are the
*header*. Its purpose is to state the function's name and say how it is
called:

``` C
int
fib (int n)
```

says that the function returns an integer (type `int`), its name is
`fib`, and it takes one argument named `n` which is also an integer.
(Data types will be explained later, in [Primitive Data
Types](Primitive-Types.md).)
