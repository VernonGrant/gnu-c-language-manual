### 6.4 Mixed-Mode Arithmetic 

Mixing integers and floating-point numbers in a basic arithmetic
operation converts the integers automatically to floating point. In most
cases, this gives exactly the desired results. But sometimes it matters
precisely where the conversion occurs.

If `i` and `j` are integers, `(i + j) * 2.0` adds them as an integer,
then converts the sum to floating point for the multiplication. If the
addition gets an overflow, that is not equivalent to converting both
integers to floating point and then adding them. You can get the latter
result by explicitly converting the integers, as in
`((double) i + (double) j) * 2.0`. See [Explicit Type
Conversion](Explicit-Type-Conversion.md).

Adding or multiplying several values, including some integers and some
floating point, does the operations left to right. Thus, `3.0 + i + j`
converts `i` to floating point, then adds 3.0, then converts `j` to
floating point and adds that. You can specify a different order using
parentheses: `3.0 + (i + j)` adds `i` and `j` first and then adds that
result (converting to floating point) to 3.0. In this respect, C differs
from other languages, such as Fortran.
