### 10.2 Associativity and Ordering 


An associative binary operator, such as `+`, when used repeatedly can
combine any number of operands. The operands' values may be computed in
any order.

If the values are integers and overflow can be ignored, they may be
combined in any order. Thus, given four functions that return
`unsigned int`, calling them and adding their results as here

``` C
(foo () + bar ()) + (baz () + quux ())
```

may add up the results in any order.

By contrast, arithmetic on signed integers, in which overflow is
significant, is not always associative (see [Integer
Overflow](Integer-Overflow.md)). Thus, the additions must be done in
the order specified, obeying parentheses and left-association. That
means computing `(foo () + bar ())` and `(baz () + quux ())` first (in
either order), then adding the two.

The same applies to arithmetic on floating-point values, since that too
is not really associative. However, the GCC option
`-funsafe-math-optimizations` allows the compiler to change the
order of calculation when an associative operation (associative in exact
mathematics) combines several operands. The option takes effect when
compiling a module (see [Compilation](Compilation.md)). Changing the
order of association can enable the program to pipeline the floating
point operations.

In all these cases, the four function calls can be done in any order.
There is no right or wrong about that.
