### 14.4 Pointer-Type Designators 

Every type in C has a designator; you make it by deleting the variable
name and the semicolon from a declaration (see [Type
Designators](Type-Designators.md)). Here are the designators for the
pointer types of the example declarations in the previous section:

``` C
int *           /* Pointer to int. */
double *        /* Pointer to double. */
double (*)[5]   /* Pointer to double[5]. */
```

Remember, to understand what type a designator stands for, imagine the
variable name that would be in the declaration, and figure out what type
it would declare that variable with. `double (*)[5]` can only come from
`double (*variable)[5]`, so it's a pointer which, when dereferenced,
gives an array of 5 `double`s.
