### 19.11 Null Statement 


A *null statement* is just a semicolon. It does nothing.

A null statement is a placeholder for use where a statement is
grammatically required, but there is nothing to be done. For instance,
sometimes all the work of a `for`-loop is done in the `for`-header
itself, leaving no work for the body. Here is an example that searches
for the first newline in `array`:

``` C
for (p = array; *p != '\n'; p++)
  ;
```
