## 2 A Complete Program 


It's all very well to write a Fibonacci function, but you cannot run it
by itself. It is a useful program, but it is not a complete program.

In this chapter we present a complete program that contains the `fib`
function. This example shows how to make the program start, how to make
it finish, how to do computation, and how to print a result.
