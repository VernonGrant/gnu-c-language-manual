## 1 The First Example 

This chapter presents the source code for a very simple C program and
uses it to explain a few features of the language. If you already know
the basic points of C presented in this chapter, you can skim it or skip
it.

We present examples of C source code (other than comments) using a
fixed-width typeface, since that's the way they look when you edit them
in an editor such as GNU Emacs.

-   [The Stack, And Stack Overflow](Stack.md)
-   [Example: Iterative Fibonacci](Iterative-Fibonacci.md)
