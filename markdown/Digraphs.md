## Appendix C Digraphs 


C accepts aliases for certain characters. Apparently in the 1990s some
computer systems had trouble inputting these characters, or trouble
displaying them. These digraphs almost never appear in C programs
nowadays, but we mention them for completeness.

'`<:`'

-   An alias for '`[`'.

'`:>`'

-   An alias for '`]`'.

'`<%`'

-   An alias for '`{`'.

'`%>`'

-   An alias for '`}`'.

'`%:`'

-   An alias for '`#`', used for preprocessing directives (see
    [Directives](Directives.md)) and macros (see
    [Macros](Macros.md)).
