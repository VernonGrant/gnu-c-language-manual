## 11 Primitive Data Types 


This chapter describes all the primitive data types of C---that is, all
the data types that aren't built up from other types. They include the
types `int` and `double` that we've already covered.

These types are all made up of bytes (see [Storage and
Data](Storage.md)).

-   [The Void Type](The-Void-Type.md)
-   [Other Data Types](Other-Data-Types.md)
