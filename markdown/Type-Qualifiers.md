## 21 Type Qualifiers 

A declaration can include type qualifiers to advise the compiler about
how the variable will be used. There are three different qualifiers,
`const`, `volatile` and `restrict`. They pertain to different issues, so
you can use more than one together. For instance, `const volatile`
describes a value that the program is not allowed to change, but might
have a different value each time the program examines it. (This might
perhaps be a special hardware register, or part of shared memory.)

If you are just learning C, you can skip this chapter.
